# Next steps

[ ] Write more complete fixtures
    [ ] Fill in class definitions + serialize, create instances for single workspace data
        [x] HyperText
            [x] also implement serialize, make app print stringified store
            [x] create HyperJSON interface
            [x] create an object-based instance of HyperText
            [x] render hypertext
                [x] clarify types for serialized objects
                [x] factor out dispatch and hypertext components
                [x] add to fixtures for cases below
                [x] implement hypertext rendering
                    [x] strings
                    [x] arrays
                    [x] nodes
                    [x] arrays with nodes
                    [x] workspace template object
                [x] split hypertext.tsx into multiple files
        [x] Clean up, commit
        [x] Node + NodeVersion
            [x] add simple fixtures
            [x] add classes
            [x] render node version, making use of hypertext render
                - don't render included nodes (since we don't know what version to render)
                - but we do need to render hypertext
                  - this mean that we need to retrieve it
                  - this can be analogous to how graphql works later
                    - (then, we do one big query at the top, and little cached queries while rendering)
            [x] extract classes from fixtures
        [ ] Workspace + WorkspaceVersion + Link
            [x] add basic workspace / workspace version / link fixtures
            [x] write corresponding classes
            [ ] write components that render these classes
                [ ] HyperText should take prop that determines how included nodes are rendered
    [ ] Try workspace with sub-workspace
        - children
    [ ] Exports    
    [ ] think about what cases will be tricky, implement them
        [ ] Showing whether things are stale
        [ ] Recursive fetching for latest state    

[ ] (Think about caching node ids for hypertext)
    - probably fine to delay until this is moved to server

[ ] Use redux or apollo
[ ] Allow root questions with data
